### Hi there 👋

#### About Me
🌹 I'm Rose Le, and I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer, specializing in frontend development.

🖱️ I recently completed a Full-Stack Software Engineer internship on a Cloud Security Team.

✊ I received formal technical training from Ada Developers Academy, where I learned JavaScript/React, Python/Flask, Computer Science Fundamentals, and Object-Oriented Programming. Through my personal projects, I have also learned Node.js/Express, NoSQL, MongoDB, and DynamoDB.

☁️ At my internship, I got to learn the basics of AWS services and Terraform. I will continue to learn and upskill in these technologies!

💻 My personal projects include [RxRoster](https://rx-roster-front-end.heroku.com), a full-stack medication tracker application, and [Wreath Skincare](https://wreath-skincare.vercel.app), a frontend ecommerce application. 

🤔 I'm currently working on iterating those personal projects! Once done, I would like to build my own personal portfolio.

🎮 Outside of tech, I enjoy reading, playing video games (Sims 2 and Tekken ftw!), doing pilates, doll collecting, and learning new languages (currently French and Spanish, as well as strengthening my Vietnamese skills).
